                                The Principles of a Protagonist Bundle

                                Chicago native Willis Earl Beal came from humble musical beginnings- he
                                began as a street performer of sorts that was prone to leaving homemade
                                novels, artwork and CD-Rs across America to promote his work, suggesting
                                a desire to be heard. Thereafter, he relocated to Albuquerque, NM where
                                he continued his practice of 'gifting' as he simultaneously recorded a
                                set of songs on a discarded karaoke machine that would become Acousmatic
                                Sorcery, his Hot Charity/XL Recordings debut.
